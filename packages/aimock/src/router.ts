 * `hasToolResult` request-SHAPE predicate — does the CURRENT turn contain a

 * message, so this is scoped to the turn being matched rather than the whole
 * conversation. This is what keeps leg-1 (tool call, `hasToolResult` false) vs
 * leg-2 (narration, `hasToolResult` true) fixtures working across MULTI-TURN
 * sessions: on the 2nd+ user turn the request still carries earlier turns' tool
 * results, and a whole-conversation check would force `hasToolResult=true`
 * forever, so the turn's leg-1 fixture (false) could never match again ("No
 * fixture matched" on every pill after the first).
 *
 * This is the SINGLE source of truth shared by the RECORD side
 * ({@link buildFixtureMatch} in recorder.ts, which STAMPS the value onto a new
 * fixture) and the MATCH side ({@link matchFixtureDiagnostic} below, which
 * CHECKS a fixture's stored value against the incoming request). The two MUST
 * agree byte-for-byte: if the recorder stamps a value the matcher would never
 * compute for the same request, a genuinely-recorded fixture can never match
 * its own request. Keeping the predicate in one function is what guarantees
 * they cannot drift.
 *
 * INVARIANT: callers MUST pass the POST-`requestTransform` (normalized)
 * messages — the same array `buildFixtureMatch` and `matchFixtureDiagnostic`
 * both feed here. Passing raw/untransformed messages on one side would let the
 * set-side and check-side diverge again and silently reopen the multi-turn bug.
 *
 * When there is no `user` message at all, `lastUserIdx` stays -1 and the scan
 * covers the whole conversation — the safe/consistent fallback for a user-less
 * request (both sides degrade identically). For a single-turn request whose
 * only tool message trails a lone user message this is identical to the old

/**
 * Choose one fixture from a set that all CONTENT-matched the same request,
 * using `turnIndex` purely as a position disambiguator (never as a reject
 * gate).
 *
 * The selection rule is applied UNIFORMLY regardless of candidate count (a
 * single candidate is NOT special-cased), so the same request never flips its
 * answer just because an unrelated content-matching fixture was registered.
 * Within every tier ties are broken by REGISTRATION ORDER — the
 * earliest-registered eligible candidate wins — preserving the historical
 * greedy "first matching fixture wins" contract.
 *
 *  1. Prefer the turnIndexed candidate whose `turnIndex` is closest to
 *     `assistantCount` WITHOUT exceeding it (the highest `turnIndex <=
 *     assistantCount`). A behind-the-count scripted turn (turnIndex <
 *     assistantCount) beats a plain fallback — an explicit position is a
 *     stronger signal than an unpositioned default. A negative `turnIndex` such
 *     as -1 is a valid at/behind position (the seed is `-Infinity`, never a `-1`
 *     sentinel that would mis-skip it). Earlier registration breaks ties among
 *     equal turnIndexes.
 *  2. EXACT-turn tie-break: when the best at/behind scripted turn sits at the
 *     EXACT current position (`turnIndex === assistantCount`) a plain fallback
 *     also answers "right now", so the two are equally eligible and REGISTRATION
 *     ORDER decides — a later-registered `turnIndex:0` does NOT override an
 *     earlier-registered fallback, and vice-versa.
 *  3. Otherwise every turnIndexed candidate is still AHEAD of the conversation.
 *     An explicit future turn must NOT answer an earlier point, so a plain
 *     fallback (eligible at every position) is the better answer — applied
 *     uniformly, INCLUDING when the fallback is the sole partner of a single
 *     future-turn fixture (the single/multi asymmetry this fixes).
 *  4. Otherwise (pure script, every candidate turnIndexed and all ahead) the
 *     script genuinely has no earlier answer, so serve the lowest `turnIndex`
 *     candidate — the false-red-kill for a lone scripted turn whose run has
 *     FEWER assistant bubbles than its `turnIndex`; registration order breaks
 *     ties.
 *
 * A future-turn fixture therefore NEVER answers an earlier-point request when an
 * eligible alternative (a fallback, or an at/behind scripted turn) exists — the
 * future-turn guard is enforced uniformly for single and multiple candidates.
 *
 * Returns the selected fixture alongside `byUniquePosition`: `true` ONLY when the
 * choice was decided by a UNIQUE positional criterion — the served fixture's
 * `turnIndex` sits EXACTLY at `assistantCount`, no earlier fallback overrode it
 * (tier 2), and no other candidate shared that exact position (so registration
 * order did not break a tie). `matchFixtureDiagnostic` maps this to
 * `matchedBy === "turnIndex"`; every other selection path (tie-break,
 * registration order, behind/ahead scripted turn, fallback) is `"content"`.
