//! Installing an engine, instead of telling somebody to go and get one.
//!
//! The person this app is for does not have a package manager, has never heard of Podman, and is
//! not going to read a release page. Every sentence that begins "install ..." is a step where an
//! install stops for good, so the engine is fetched and installed here.
//!
//! Two things are fetched, not one, and the second is the one that gets forgotten. Podman ships no
//! Compose implementation: `podman compose` looks for an external provider on PATH and, finding
//! none, answers with seven errors naming `docker-compose`. So a machine with a freshly installed
//! Podman still cannot raise the stack. Compose is a single static binary, which is why it can be
//! placed rather than installed.
//!
//! **Nothing fetched here is run unverified.** These files are executed, so each is pinned to the
//! digest of the release this was tested against, and a mismatch is refused rather than run.
//! Fetching a checksum from the same server that served the file would prove nothing.
//!
//! The three platforms install differently and only one of them is unattended:
//!
//! - **Windows.** The MSI is a per-user install, so it needs no elevation and lands in the profile
//!   of whoever runs it. That is also the trap: run from a service or an elevated helper it lands
//!   in `C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile`, where the person's own session cannot see it.
//!   Measured, on Windows Server 2022, by installing it from a service and then watching the app
//!   report no engine while `podman.exe` sat on disk. It has to run as them, which is where the app
//!   already runs.
//! - **macOS.** The package writes to `/opt/podman` and needs administrator rights, so the person
//!   sees one standard macOS authorization prompt. There is no way around that prompt and no reason
//!   to want one: it is the same dialog every other installer raises.
//! - **Linux.** Podman there is not a binary but a set of them (`conmon`, `crun`, `netavark`,
//!   `slirp4netns`), wired to the distribution's own paths, so downloading one file would produce
//!   something that runs nothing. The distribution's package manager installs it, through
//!   `pkexec`, which raises that desktop's own authorization prompt.
