//!
//! Two providers are first-class and everything else is one row. That is not a shortlist waiting to
//! be grown: it is the shape, and growing it is how this screen turns into a directory nobody
//! maintains. Most people have a plan with one of two companies; everybody else has something that
//! speaks the OpenAI wire format, because at this point everything does.
//!
//! The row that asks for a URL is the last one, and it is the only one that asks. Keeping it there
//! is what keeps a base URL off the main path, which the audience rule at the top of the build doc
//! requires: somebody who has never opened a terminal finishes this screen by signing in.
//!
//! Independent of the harness picker, always. No harness on that list is tied to a vendor's models,
//! so nothing chosen there may narrow what is offered here.
